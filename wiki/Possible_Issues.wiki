= Issue #1 =

If you see an error like the one shown bellow and you did make the dummy MPI library in directory LAMMPSDIR/src/STUBS/ try to find a _!*.a_ file in there. There is a chance that it has a different name (_!libmpi_stubs.a_ for example). Renaming it to _!libmpi.a_ should fix the issue.

{{{
g++: ../STUBS/libmpi.a: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [../lmp_serial] Error 1
make: *** [serial] Error 2

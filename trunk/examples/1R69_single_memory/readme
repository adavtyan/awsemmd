1. Run unfolding simulations (simulated annealing with increasing temperature).
Copy the folder to Rice cluster Davinci, within the folder, type
	$ qsub unfolding.pbs
'unfolding.pbs' file contains the commands to run the simulation, the name of the input file, and scripts for post-simulation calculations.
After the simulation finishes, plot file '1_q' to see how the structure unfolds when temperature increases. Compare your results with the file unfolding_q.png.

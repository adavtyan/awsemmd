= Building LAMMPS with AWSEM =


=== What do you need: ===
  * June 3rd, 2011 version of LAMMPS: http://lammps.sandia.gov/tars/lammps-3Jun11.tar.gz
  * FFTW 2.1.5: http://www.fftw.org/fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz
  * AWSEM code (see Source->Checkout)


=== Step by step guide ===
  * Download and unzip FFTW 2.1.5
  * Install FFTW 2.1.5 somewhere locally using _./conﬁgure –preﬁx=/your_home_directory/local; make; make install_
  * Download and unzip LAMMPS source code
  * Copy all .cpp and .h file from awsemmd directory to LAMMPS_DIR/src/
  * Go to LAMMPSDIR/src/STUBS/ and execute make command to compile a dummy MPI library
  * Copy awsemmd/Makefiles/Makefile.serial file to LAMMPS_DIR/src/MAKE/ and adjust the paths according to FFTW installation above
  * Go back to LAMMPS_DIR/src/ directory and execute _make clean-all_; _make serial_
  * If everything goes well, you must find lmp_serial executable in src directory.

= Generating project =

The easiest way to generate a LAMMPS-AWSEM project is to do that using a pdb file which contains the structure of interest
  * First of all go to awsemmd/create_project_tool/ and execute _install_tools.sh_ script. This will copy all necessary scripts in /your_home_directory/opt/script/.
  * Add /your_home_directory/opt/script/ to PATH variable (call _echo $PATH_ to make sure that you did it right)
  * Copy lmp_serial and the pdb file to a same directory
  * From that directory call _PdbCoords2Lammps\.sh pdb_id project_name_

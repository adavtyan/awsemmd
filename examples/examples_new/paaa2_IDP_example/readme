A common pipeline to run AWSEM-IDP simulation (take PaaA2 as example):

1. Create initial files for AWSEM simulation using a pre-existing structure of the target IDP (5AAA-1.pdb).

2. Run unfolding simulation (unfold.in) to obtain a random initial configuration.

3. Run annealing simulation (annealing.in) to decrease the temperature to desired value (e.g. room temperature).

4. Run equilibration simulation (equil.in) at desired temperature to reach equilibrated state.

5. Run constT simulation (constT.in) to obtain final ensemble.

Most parameters are subject to change (some parameters in fix_backbone_coeff.data, fragment memory, Rg potential, thermostat, temperature, run timesteps, etc), depending on the specific protein and related scientific questions. Always visualize the obtained trajectories (with BuildAllAtomsFromLammps_seq.py) to check their sanity before further data analysis.

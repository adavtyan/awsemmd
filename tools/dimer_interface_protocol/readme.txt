- Execute the directory using Python 3. Eg: "python3 /mnt/e/awsemmd/dimer_interface_protocol"

- Ensure that the command python2 runs Python 2.

- Ensure that the file /dimer_interface_protocol/files/fix_backbone_coeff.data is appropriate for your analysis. For instance, if there are any phosphorylated residues, that needs to be activated.

- Ensure that the input pdb has exactly two chains, with no heteroatoms (such as metals, or water).

- Remember to edit the parameters file

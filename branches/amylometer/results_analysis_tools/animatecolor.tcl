# This is a TCL script that was adapted by Nick Schafer from code found on the internet
# It can be used to load a pdb file with color information in the b-factor field of a
# PDB and update that information frame by frame during the playback in VMD.
# This was originally designed to be used with Bobby Kim's local Q calculation, but
# should be suitable for animating any color information in the b-factor field, so long
# as the min, max and midpoint are adjusted properly (according to the range of the data).

# To use this script, use:                                # 
# vmd -e animatecolor.tcl -args movie                     # 
# where "movie" is the prefix to your .pdb and .psf files.#

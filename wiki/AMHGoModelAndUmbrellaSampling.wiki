#summary This page introduces the use of AMH-Go and umbrella sampling.

= Introduction =
This page introduces the use of AMH-Go, a non-additve structure based model included in the AWSEM simulation package, and the use of umbrella sampling over a collective coordinate for the purposes of performing free energy profile and expectation value calculations.
AMH-Go is a non-additive structure based model, which is described in detail in:
Eastwood, Michael P., and Peter G. Wolynes. "Role of explicitly cooperative interactions in protein folding funnels: a simulation study." The Journal of Chemical Physics 114 (2001): 4702.

= Example: running an AMH-Go simulation = 

  == Obtain a structure of your protein of interest from the PDB (www.pdb.org) or elsewhere. ==
  The structure should have coordinates for at least the backbone atoms and C-beta for all residues that you are interested in simulating. For the purposes of illustration, we will use Ubiquitin (pdb id: [http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1ubq 1UBQ]).
  == Generate the input files and copy the necessary parameter files to the current working directory.==
  == Edit the fix_backbone_coeff.data file to include an active [AMH-Go] block.==
  == Set the parameters within the [AMH-Go] block.==
  == Run a simulation.==

= Example: applying a collective coordinate bias = 

  == Add a fix qbias command to your input file.==
  == Compute collective coordinates on the fly using compute functions==
  == Setup multiple directories==
  == Run all simulations==
  == Collect the data==

= Example: analyzing umbrella sampled data, calculating free energy profiles =

  == Choose the dimension of the plot==
  == Choose the quantity to plot==
  == Choose the plotting variables==
  == Perform the calculation==
  == Plot the results==
  == Interpret the results==

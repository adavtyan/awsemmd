========================29.01.96 ==========================

1. I can not supply the compiled Vax VMS version any
   more since I have no access to old VAXes. OPENVMS
   version is still available.
2. Bug fixed: if a PDB file has no HEADER record,
   or if this record does not contain the 4-letter
   structure code, STRIDE produces output with no
   line breaks. This has now been fixed. I thank
   STRIDE users for reporting this bug
3. Please note that the maximal number of atoms in
   one residue is set to 50. This is in principle
   more than enough. However, if your coordinate set
   contains large things (like FAD) which are erraneously
   in the ATOM records, STRIDE will not work. Such groups
   should be put in HETATM records, where the current limit
   is 200 atoms. You can always change these limits by
   modifying the following two lines in the file stride.h:

   #define MAX_AT_IN_RES             50
   #define MAX_AT_IN_HETERORES       200

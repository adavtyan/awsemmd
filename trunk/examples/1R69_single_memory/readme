1. Run unfolding simulations (simulated annealing with increasing temperature).
Copy the folder to the scratch space of Rice cluster Davinci
	$ cp ./* /scratch/username/work/1R69/
Go into the new folder, type
	$ qsub unfolding.pbs
'unfolding.pbs' file contains the commands to run the simulation, the name of the input file, and scripts for post-simulation calculations.
After the simulation finishes, plot file '1_q' to see how the structure unfolds when temperature increases. Compare your results with the file unfolding_qo.png.

2. Run folding simulations (simulated annealing with decreasing temperature).
	$qsub folding.pbs
After the simulation finishes, plot file '2_qw' to see how the structure folds when temperature decreases. Compare your results with the file folding_qw.png.
